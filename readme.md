# edeXa ERC-20 Token
Welcome to the edeXa ERC-20 Token repository! This repository contains the smart contract and related resources for the edeXa company's ERC-20 token. The edeXa token is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC-20 token standard.

# ERC-20 Token Details
Token Name: edeXa Token
Token Symbol: EDX
Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 EDX
Decimals: 18

# Smart Contract
The smart contract for the edeXa ERC-20 Token is implemented in Solidity programming language. The contract follows the ERC-20 standard, which defines a set of functions and events that allow for seamless integration with various wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts.

The main contract file is edeXa.sol. It contains the implementation of the token contract, including functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and managing approvals. The contract also includes additional features such as pausing and burning tokens.

# Deployment
The edeXa ERC-20 Token smart contract can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using tools such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Before deployment, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and a compatible Ethereum development environment set up.

To deploy the token contract, follow these steps:

Compile the smart contract: Use your preferred development tool to compile the edeXa.sol file. Make sure there are no compilation errors and that the bytecode and ABI are generated successfully.

Select the desired Ethereum network: Determine the Ethereum network (e.g., mainnet, testnet, or a local development network) where you want to deploy the token contract. Configure your development tool to connect to the desired network.

Set the deployment parameters: Specify the deployment parameters such as the token name, symbol, total supply, and other optional parameters defined in the constructor of the edeXa.sol contract.

Deploy the contract: Trigger the deployment process using your development tool. Review the transaction details and confirm the deployment. Once the deployment is successful, note the deployed contract address for further reference.

# Token Usage
